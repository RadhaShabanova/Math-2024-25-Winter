### 6. We have the line y = 2x + 3. Find an example of a line perpendicular and parallel to it.

For parallel:

We can replace 'k' with any constant in both situations.

### 7. We have the line y = 2x + 3 and point A(1,2). Find the distance from point A to the line.

Using Perpendicular and Distance tool.

### 8. The line intersects the coordinate axes at points A(2,0) and B(0,3). Find the equation of the line.

Angle = 315, in other words it is 45 degrees.

### 10. Provide a vector perpendicular to the line x + y + 1 = 0.
