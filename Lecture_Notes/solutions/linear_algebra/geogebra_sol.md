We can replace 'k' with any constant in both situations.

### 7. We have the line y = 2x + 3 and point A(1,2). Find the distance from point A to the line.

Using circle tool

### 2. Find the equation of a parabola intersecting the Ox axis at points x = 2, x = 4, and passing through point y(3) = 1.

1. The general equation of the parabola is $y=a(x−2)(x−4)$ , since it intersects the x-axis at x=2 and x=4.

2. Use the condition that it passes through (3,1): 
$1=a(3−2)(3−4)$
Solve for a:
$a = −1$

The equation becomes 
$y=−(x−2)(x−4)$ .
