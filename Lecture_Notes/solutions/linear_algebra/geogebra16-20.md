#### 2. The plane passes through point A(1,2,3) and is parallel to the plane 2x+3y+4z=5. Find the equation of the plane.

The plane we are looking for must be parallel to the given plane 2x+3y+4z=5.

A parallel plane will have the same normal vector n=(2,3,4).


The general equation of a plane with normal vector (a,b,c) is ax+by+cz=d.


The plane passes through the point A(1,2,3).

Substituting x=1,y=2,z=3 into 2x+3y+4z=d, we solve for 2(1)+3(2)+4(3)=d⟹d=2+6+12=20.


Therefore, the equation of the plane is:
2x+3y+4z=20.
