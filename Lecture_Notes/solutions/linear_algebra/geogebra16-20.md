#### 2. The plane passes through point A(1,2,3) and is parallel to the plane 2x+3y+4z=5. Find the equation of the plane.

The plane we are looking for must be parallel to the given plane 2x+3y+4z=5.

A parallel plane will have the same normal vector n=(2,3,4).


The general equation of a plane with normal vector (a,b,c) is ax+by+cz=d.


The plane passes through the point A(1,2,3).

Substituting x=1,y=2,z=3 into 2x+3y+4z=d, we solve for 2(1)+3(2)+4(3)=d⟹d=2+6+12=20.


Therefore, the equation of the plane is:
2x+3y+4z=20.

#### 3. The plane passes through point A(1,2,3) and is perpendicular to the normal vector n = [2,3,4]. Find the equation of the plane.


The plane passes through the point $A(1, 2, 3)$ .
The normal vector to the plane is $\mathbf{n} = [2, 3, 4]$ .

The general equation of a plane with a normal vector$ \mathbf{n} = [a, b, c] $ is:

   $$
   a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0,
   $$

where $ (x_0, y_0, z_0) $ is a point on the plane.

Substitute Values:
   - Normal vector: $ a = 2, b = 3, c = 4 $.
   - Point $ A(1, 2, 3) $ : $ x_0 = 1, y_0 = 2, z_0 = 3 $ .

   Substituting into the equation:

   $$
   2(x - 1) + 3(y - 2) + 4(z - 3) = 0.
   $$

Simplify the Equation:

Expand and simplify:

   $$
   2x - 2 + 3y - 6 + 4z - 12 = 0,
   $$

   $$
   2x + 3y + 4z - 20 = 0.
   $$

   The equation of the plane is:

   $$
   2x + 3y + 4z = 20.
   $$
